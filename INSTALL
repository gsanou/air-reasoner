Installing air-reasoner as a CGI script (on Ubuntu)?  Here's how:

1. Make sure that CGI is properly enabled (e.g. in your
/etc/apache2/sites-available/[site] file, you should see a reference
to "ServerAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/", and some <Directory>
settings for /usr/lib/cgi-bin (or the equivalent place for running CGI
scripts.

2. Copy server_cgi.py from this repository to the place where your CGI
scripts are stored (e.g. /usr/lib/cgi-bin).

3. Copy this repository to the "airreasoner" directory within that
same place. (e.g. "/usr/lib/cgi-bin/airreasoner")

4. Make sure that references to policyrunner in the server_cgi.py file
you copied refer to airreasoner.policyrunner, so as to access the copy
of the repository.
