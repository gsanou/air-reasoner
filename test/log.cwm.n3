# 1. Prox Card data can only be used for criminal investigations
# 2. adverse consequence: being called in for a disciplinary hearing
# 3. This particular CoD hearing is not criminal investigation

# Student Sam asks TA Ted for extension due to illness.

# TA Ted looked at Prox Card data to figure out that Sam was in CSAIL
# at 9:45am Monday, 5th floor.

# TA Ted infers that Student Sam was faking illness.

# TA Ted tells Professor Pam about Sam faking illness to get an
# extension.

# Professor Pam files complaint with CoD about Student Sam faking
# illness to get an extension, providing prox card data as evidence.

# Student Sam is called in for a disciplinary hearing by CoD based on
# the complaint.

# AIR is trying to figure out if CoD calling Student Sam in for a
# hearing violates MIT Privacy policies.

# Prohibited to commit AcademicFraud sanction "you will be charged
# with AcademicFraud by CoD".

# Rule: If you are FakingIllnessForExtension then you will be charged
# with AcademicFraud.
